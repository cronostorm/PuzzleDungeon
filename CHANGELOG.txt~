Puzzle Dungeon

Goal		- 
2D dungeon crawling game with puzzle component. 
Game is split into two halves: the 'dungeon' half, and the 'puzzle' half.
Game flow is turn based, the player will take one turn in the puzzle half of 
the board, and then another in the dungeon half. Then, the AI characters will
be given a turn. This repeats until the level is finished or the character dies.

The dungeon half of the game will involve a character crawling through a randomly
generated dungeon with monsters, loot, and different kinds of terrain. 
The player has numerous stats that are used to crawl the dungeon: 
	Health		- The amount of health the character currently has
	Gold			- The amount of gold the character has
	Movement	- Number of moves the character can take this turn
	Attack		- Number of times the character can attack this turn
	Defense		- Number of damage the character can block this turn
	Magic			- Number of spells the character can cast this turn
Health and Gold are preserved from turn to turn, but the other stats are not.

The puzzle half of the game is involves a swapping game where the goal is to 
match 3 or more of the same shape. Matching a shape grants a corresponding
stat for use in the dungeon portion of the game.

Game flow example: 
- Player starts with some base stats:
	5 health, 0 gold, 1 move, 0 attack, 0 defense, 0 magic
Puzzle Turn 1		: Player matches 3 movement icons, granting 1 move.
Dungeon Turn 1	: Player has 2 moves, and moves left twice. 
AI Turn 1				: Enemy Bat moves right and attacks Player. 
									Player now has 4 health.
Puzzle Turn 2		: Player matches 3 health icons and 4 attack icons, 
									granting one health and 2 attack.
									Player now has 5 health.
Dungeon Turn 1	: Player attacks and kills bat, player is granted 1 gold.
									All enemies are dead, the dungeon is cleared.

Week 1	- 
I: Wrote a dungeon generator that generates random tiles, textures a 2d plane
	 with the corresponding colors. 
B: Wrote a random puzzle generator made of cubes. Can check if 3 in a row are
	 matched

Week 2 - 
I: Added discrete player controls, added specific tile types, checks for 
	 colliisions with walls.
B: Added variable handles (Board size, number of colors, kind of colors)
	 Falling and swapping implemented.
	There is currently a bug where the board randomly resets after update.
	However when update is only called once, the board gets cleared and then blocks fall down, which indicates that
	mechanic works.

Week 3 - 
I: Added A* path finding, Press 1 to show closest path to a tile 3,3 up-right
	ofyou
B: Added swapping gems

Week 4 - 
I: Added intelligent dungeon generation. Press 1 to put a marker down, Press 2
	to find the shortest path to the marker
